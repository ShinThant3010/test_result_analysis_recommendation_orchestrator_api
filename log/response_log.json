While this is a good foundation, focusing on the five questions you answered incorrectly presents a valuable opportunity for targeted improvement. Refining your understanding of grammar rules, particularly around sentence connectors and verb forms, will help you achieve an even higher score.\n\n**Area to be Improved:** To elevate your English proficiency, concentrate on enhancing your grasp of logical connectors to clearly express relationships between ideas. Special attention should also be given to the accurate formation and usage of the passive voice, including with modal verbs. Clarifying the proper application of relative pronouns and mastering correct word form selection in context will be key areas for growth.\n\n**Recommended Course:**\n\n- **Conjunctions & Sentence Structure**: This course will clarify how to effectively use coordinating, subordinating, and correlative conjunctions to build complex and grammatically correct sentences, improving overall sentence flow. - Link: https://example.com/toeic-conjunctions\n\n- **Connectors & Transition Signals**: Learn to master the use of conjunctive adverbs and other transitional phrases to create clear, logical connections between ideas and clauses, enhancing cohesion in your writing and speaking. - Link: https://example.com/toeic-connectors\n\n- **Noun Clauses & Relative Pronouns**: This course focuses on identifying and correctly using noun clauses and relative pronouns to introduce dependent clauses, helping you avoid common errors in complex sentence constructions. - Link: https://example.com/toeic-relative-clauses\n\n- **Modifiers & Sentence Logic**: Develop a stronger grasp of how modifiers function within sentences, ensuring they logically connect to the elements they describe and avoiding misplaced or dangling modifiers. - Link: https://example.com/toeic-modifiers\n\n- **Verbs & Tenses for TOEIC Part 5**: Specifically designed for the TOEIC Part 5, this course will review various verb tenses, irregular verbs, and the proper application of active and passive voice, including with modal verbs, to improve your grammar accuracy. - Link: https://example.com/toeic-verbs-tenses"
