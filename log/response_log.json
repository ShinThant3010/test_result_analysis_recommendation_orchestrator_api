By the end of this course, you'll be able to write small programs in Python that use variables, mathematical operators, and logical operators. For example, you could write programs that carry out complex mathematical operations, like calculating the interest rate necessary to reach a savings goal, recommending apparel options based on weather patterns, or calculating a grade based on multiple percentages. Structurally, the course is comprised of several parts. Instruction is delivered via a series of short (2-3 minute) videos. In between those videos, you'll complete both multiple choice questions and coding problems to demonstrate your knowledge of the material that was just covered. Computer Science",

In this Beginner online course in data analysis, we will use matrix algebra to represent the linear models that commonly used to model differences between experimental units. We perform statistical inference on these differences. Throughout the course we will use the R programming language to perform matrix operations.Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the Beginner biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses. You will need to know some basic stats for this course. By the third course will be teaching advanced statistical concepts such as hierarchical models and by the fourth advanced software engineering skills, such as parallel computing and reproducible research concepts.These courses make up two Professional Certificates and are self-paced:Data Analysis for Life Sciences:Genomics Data Analysis:This class was supported in part by NIH grant R25GM114818.

              "description": "We live in a world of numbers. You see them every day: on clocks, in the stock market, in sports, and all over the news. Algebra is all about figuring out the numbers you don't see. You might know how fast you can throw a ball, but can you use this number to determine how far you can throw it? You might keep track of stock prices, but how can you figure out how much money you've made (or lost) in the market? And you may already know how to tell time, but can you calculate at what times a clock's hour and minute hands are exactly aligned? With algebra, you can answer all of these questions, using the numbers you already know to solve for the unknown. Algebra is an essential tool for all of high school and college-level math, science, and engineering. So if you're starting out in one of these fields and you haven't yet mastered algebra, then this is the course for you! In this course, you'll be able to choose your own path within each lesson, and you can jump between lessons to quickly review earlier material. AlgebraX covers a standard curriculum in high school Algebra I, and CCSS (common core) alignment is indicated where applicable.Learn more about our High School and AP* Exam Preparation Courses Math",

You will learn concepts necessary to define estimates and margins of errors and learn how you can use these to make predictions relatively well and also provide an estimate of the precision of your forecast. Once you learn this you will be able to understand two concepts that are ubiquitous in data science: confidence intervals, and p-values. Then, to understand statements about the probability of a candidate winning, you will learn about Bayesian modeling. Finally, at the end of the course, we will put it all together to recreate a simplified version of an election forecast model and apply it to the 2016 election. Data Analysis & Statistics",

We will address the behavioral and quantitative facets of project management, as well as the use of methods, tools and techniques for the initiation, planning, execution and closing of projects. The course will be divided by the project life cycle phases.First, we will cover project initiation. We will review projects in organizations, project selection models, the project manager role and project organization structures to better understand how a project is initiated. You will also learn how to create a key project management deliverable, the project charter.Second, we will cover the project-planning phase. You will learn how to build a comprehensive project management plan covering the key aspects of risk, quality, scope, schedule, cost, time, resource and communications.Third, we will cover the project execution phase. We will explore the monitoring and control of a project including earned value analysis and project reporting. Case studies and examples will be used to help you understand the correct actions for a project manager to take to keep a project in control.",

This examination of what makes a \"good person\"--called virtue ethics--has long been the purview of philosophers and theologians. So what do the world's great religious and secular philosophies have to say about ethical conduct? Which virtues are common across creeds and cultures? And what role do ethics, spirituality, and religious communities have to play in sustainable development? In 2016, distinguished leaders from the world's major religious traditions, philosophers, scholars, and scientists were invited by Pope Francis to the Vatican for a series of meetings. Known as the Ethics in Action initiative, these meetings sought to promote dialogue and find consensus about the values needed to advance transformative action for our common home and the human family. This course features Ethics in Action meeting participants, as well as other leading voices, and discusses the perspectives of some of the world's great traditions and their role in addressing our world's most pressing challenges, including poverty, corruption, and climate change.

            "description": "The student struggles to correctly identify and differentiate dynamic markings, which indicate volume changes, from other musical instructions like tempo (speed) or articulation (how notes are played). This suggests a general confusion within the expressive elements of music, mistaking one type of performance instruction for another."

              "description": "Perhaps the most popular data science methodologies come from machine learning. What distinguishes machine learning from other computer guided decision processes is that it builds prediction algorithms using data. Some of the most popular products that use machine learning include the handwriting readers implemented by the postal service, speech recognition, movie recommendation systems, and spam detectors. In this course,part ofourProfessional Certificate Program in Data Science, you will learn popular machine learning algorithms, principal component analysis, and regularization by building a movie recommendation system. You will learn about training data, and how to use a set of data to discover potentially predictive relationships. As you build the movie recommendation system, you will learn how to train algorithms using training data so you can predict the outcome for future datasets. You will also learn about overtraining and techniques to avoid it such as cross-validation. All of these skills are fundamental to machine learning. Data Analysis & Statistics",
